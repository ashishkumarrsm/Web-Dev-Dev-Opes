# 🚀 Web Development Journey - Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of my web development journey!  
I'm starting my path as a developer by learning **HTML and CSS** through hands-on practice. Today, I recreated a basic layout of the **Visual Studio Code** landing page using **pure HTML** and **Flexbox layout**.

## 🌐 Project: VS Code Landing Page Clone

This project is a simple replica of the Visual Studio Code official landing page, built using only **HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript or frameworks). The goal is to understand layout structure, styling using classes, and Flexbox alignment.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- Flexbox properties:
  - `display: flex`
  - `justify-content`, `align-items`
- Using external CSS stylesheets
- Responsive basic layout
